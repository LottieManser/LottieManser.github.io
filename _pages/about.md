### me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at <b>Kingâ€™s College London</b>, working with Professor Rachel Bearon. I use mathematical tools to solve complex biological problems.

My current research focuses on understanding the biomechancis (e.g `stiffness` or `elasticity`) of tumours and their surroundings change how they respond, with the goal of improving drug delivery to chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer tumours. I also work in modelling evolutionary developmental biology, especially how underlying rules give rise to complex feedback systems, such as different developmental tempos or morphology.

I am passionate about interdisciplinary research, and am keen to foster collaborations between biologists, mathematicians and physicists. Please get in touch if you want to chat about anything!

### research areas
<ul>
    <li>Mathematical modelling of cancer tumours and drug delivery.</li>
    <li>Evolutionary developmental biology and tempo control in development.</li>
    <li>Gene regulatory networks and systems-level feedback.</li>
    <li>Stochastic effects on gene regulation.</li>
</ul>

When I have time I also play trombone in a brass band and sew stuff :yarn:.
