I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at King’s College London, working with Professor Rachel Bearon. I use mathematical tools to solve complex biological problems.

My current research focuses on understanding the biomechancis (e.g 'stiffnes' or elasticity') of tumours and their surroundings change how they respond, with the goal of improving drug delivery to chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer tumours. I also work in modelling evolutionary developmental biology, especially how underlying rules give rise to complex feedback systems, such as different developmental tempos or morphology.

After completing an undergraduate degree in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2020, I pursued a master’s degree in Systems Biology, which I completed in 2021. I earned my PhD from Imperial College London in 2025, on Mechanistic Control of Tempo and Function in Gene Regulation via Quantitative Modelling, under the supervision of Dr Ruben Perez-Carrasco. Also in early 2025, I was awarded a JSPS fellowship to carry out a three-month research project with the Matsuzaki Lab at Kyoto University.

I am passionate about interdisciplinary research, and am keen to foster collaborations between biologists, mathematicians and physicists. Please get in touch if you want to chat about anything!
