Charlotte Manser is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at King’s College London, with a passion for applying mathematical tools to solve complex biological problems.

Her research focuses on the development and analysis of mathematical models of systems-level biological phenomena, particularly in the context of cancer, with the goal of improving drug delivery to chemotherapy-resistant tumours. She is also interested in modelling evolutionary developmental biology, especially how underlying rules give rise to complex feedback systems that drive large-scale and long-term evolutionary change.

After completing an undergraduate degree in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2020, she pursued a master’s degree in Systems Biology, which she completed in 2021. She received her PhD from Imperial College London in 2025, on Mechanistic Control of Tempo and Function in Gene Regulation via Quantitative Modelling. That same year, she was awarded a JSPS fellowship to carry out a three-month research project with the Matsuzaki Lab at Kyoto University.

Charlotte is passionate about interdisciplinary research, especially fostering collaborations between mathematicians, physicists, and experimentalists. She has presented her work at several international conferences, including oral presentations at London Mathematical Biology 2024, KSMB-SMB 2024, Euro Evo Devo 2024, and DSABNS 2024.

#Research areas:
•	Mathematical modelling of cancer tumours and drug delivery.
•	Evolutionary developmental biology and timing control in development.
•	Gene regulatory networks and systems-level feedback.
•	Stochastic effects on gene regulation.
